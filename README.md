# C++ Student Roster System

This is a command-line application built in C++ that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage a student roster.

The application parses a list of student data, stores them as objects, and provides an interface to manipulate and report on the data.

## Features
* **Data Parsing:** Ingests a list of comma-delimited strings and parses them into `Student` objects.
* **OOP Design:** Uses `Student` and `Roster` classes to encapsulate data and functionality.
* **Roster Management:** Allows for adding, removing, and printing all students.
* **Data Validation:** Includes a function to check for and report invalid email addresses.
* **Reporting:** Includes functions to:
    * Print all students in a specific degree program.
    * Calculate and print the average number of days in a course for a specific student.
